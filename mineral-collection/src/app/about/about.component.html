      <h2>Why Kunstkamera?</h2>
      <p>
        The name <em>Kunstkamera</em> harks back to the
        <strong>cabinets of wonders</strong> from centuries pastâ€”early
        precursors to museums, where scholars, naturalists, and collectors
        preserved rare objects, specimens, and artifacts.
